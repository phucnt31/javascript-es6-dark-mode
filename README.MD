## Introduction

- The Dark Mode project showcases the application of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) features by creating a dynamic project that allows users to toggle between light and dark modes. Additionally, it utilizes ES6 to render local data using JavaScript. This project provides a customizable interface with different color schemes and the ability to display locally stored data.
